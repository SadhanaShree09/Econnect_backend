# Chat and Document Review Notification Implementation Summary

## Overview
Enhanced the E-connect platform with proper notification system for chat messages and document review workflows, following the existing notification architecture and E-connect flow patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend - Notification Functions (Mongo.py)

#### A. Chat Notification Functions

**`create_chat_message_notification(sender_id, receiver_id, sender_name, message_preview, chat_type)`**
- Creates notification when a user receives a direct chat message
- Parameters:
  - `sender_id`: ID of message sender
  - `receiver_id`: ID of message receiver
  - `sender_name`: Name of the sender
  - `message_preview`: First 50 characters of message
  - `chat_type`: 'direct' or 'group'
- Features:
  - Prevents duplicate notifications (30-second window)
  - Sends real-time WebSocket notifications
  - Directs to `/User/Chat` page
  - Priority: medium

**`create_group_chat_notification(sender_id, group_id, sender_name, group_name, message_preview, member_ids)`**
- Creates notifications for all group members when a message is posted
- Excludes the sender from receiving notification
- Features:
  - Sends to all group members except sender
  - Includes group name in notification
  - Priority: low (as group chats are less urgent)
  - Directs to `/User/Chat` page

#### B. Document Review Notification Functions

**`create_document_assignment_notification(userid, doc_name, assigned_by_name, assigned_by_id)`**
- Notifies employee when a document is assigned to them
- Features:
  - Personalized message with employee name
  - Prevents duplicate notifications (1-minute window)
  - Priority: high (important for compliance)
  - Directs to `/User/OnboardingDocs` page
  - Metadata includes assignment details

**`create_document_upload_notification(userid, doc_name, uploaded_by_name, uploaded_by_id, reviewer_ids)`**
- Notifies HR and managers when an employee uploads a document
- Auto-detects reviewers (HR department users + employee's manager)
- Features:
  - Sends to multiple reviewers
  - Personalized based on reviewer role
  - Priority: high
  - Directs to appropriate review page (`/admin` for HR, `/Manager/OnboardingDocs` for managers)
  - Metadata includes uploader details

**`create_document_review_notification(userid, doc_name, reviewer_name, reviewer_id, status, remarks)`**
- Notifies employee when their document is reviewed
- Different messages for Verified/Rejected/Other statuses
- Features:
  - Status-based messaging (✅ for approved, ❌ for rejected)
  - Includes reviewer remarks if provided
  - Priority: high for rejected, medium for approved
  - Directs to `/User/OnboardingDocs` page
  - Metadata includes review details

### 2. Backend - WebSocket Integration (Server.py)

#### A. Direct Chat WebSocket (`/ws/{userid}`)
```python
# Added notification creation when message is sent
await Mongo.create_chat_message_notification(
    sender_id=userid,
    receiver_id=msg["to_user"],
    sender_name=sender_name,
    message_preview=message_text,
    chat_type="direct"
)
```
- Integrated into existing websocket message handler
- Only triggers for text messages (not reactions or other events)
- Graceful error handling to not break chat functionality

#### B. Group Chat WebSocket (`/ws/group/{group_id}`)
```python
# Added notification creation for group messages
await Mongo.create_group_chat_notification(
    sender_id=sender_id,
    group_id=group_id,
    sender_name=sender_name,
    group_name=group_name,
    message_preview=message_text,
    member_ids=member_ids
)
```
- Fetches group info to get member list
- Sends notifications to all members except sender
- Error handling to prevent notification failures from breaking chat

#### C. Document Assignment Endpoint (`/assign_docs`)
```python
# Added notification after successful document assignment
await Mongo.create_document_assignment_notification(
    userid=uid,
    doc_name=payload.docName,
    assigned_by_name=assigned_by,
    assigned_by_id=None
)
```
- Changed from sync to async function
- Sends notification to each user receiving document assignment
- Non-blocking error handling

#### D. Document Upload Endpoint (`/upload_document`)
```python
# Added notification after successful document upload
await Mongo.create_document_upload_notification(
    userid=userid,
    doc_name=docName,
    uploaded_by_name=user_name,
    uploaded_by_id=userid,
    reviewer_ids=None  # Auto-detects HR and manager
)
```
- Notifies all relevant reviewers (HR and manager)
- Includes uploader's name for context

#### E. Document Review Endpoint (`/review_document`)
```python
# Added notification after document review
await Mongo.create_document_review_notification(
    userid=payload.userId,
    doc_name=payload.docName,
    reviewer_name="Document Reviewer",
    reviewer_id=None,
    status=payload.status,
    remarks=payload.remarks
)
```
- Changed from sync to async function
- Notifies employee of review outcome
- Includes status and remarks

## Notification Flow

### Chat Notification Flow
1. User A sends message to User B via WebSocket
2. Message is saved to database
3. Message is sent to User B via WebSocket
4. **NEW:** Notification is created and sent to User B
5. User B sees both the chat message AND gets a notification
6. If User B is not in chat view, notification appears in notification bell
7. Clicking notification directs to `/User/Chat`

### Document Assignment Flow
1. HR/Admin assigns document to employee
2. Document is added to employee's assigned_docs array
3. **NEW:** Notification is sent to employee
4. Employee receives real-time notification
5. Employee can click to go directly to `/User/OnboardingDocs`

### Document Upload Flow
1. Employee uploads document via `/upload_document`
2. Document is saved to GridFS/MongoDB
3. Employee's document status updated to "Uploaded"
4. **NEW:** Notifications sent to HR and employee's manager
5. Reviewers receive real-time notifications
6. Reviewers can click to review the document

### Document Review Flow
1. HR/Manager reviews document and updates status
2. Document status updated (Verified/Rejected)
3. **NEW:** Notification sent to employee
4. Employee receives real-time notification with status
5. Employee can view remarks and take action if needed

## Key Features

### 1. Duplicate Prevention
- Chat: 30-second window to prevent notification spam
- Document Assignment: 1-minute window
- Uses metadata matching to identify duplicates

### 2. Real-time Delivery
- All notifications use `create_notification_with_websocket()`
- Instant delivery to connected users
- Fallback to database if user offline

### 3. Priority-based
- Chat (direct): medium priority
- Chat (group): low priority
- Document operations: high priority
- Affects notification ordering and display

### 4. Role-based Routing
- Notifications direct to appropriate pages based on user role
- HR → `/admin`
- Manager → `/Manager/OnboardingDocs`
- Employee → `/User/OnboardingDocs` or `/User/Chat`

### 5. Contextual Information
- All notifications include relevant metadata
- Sender/uploader/reviewer names
- Document names, message previews
- Status and remarks for reviews

### 6. Non-breaking Implementation
- All notification code wrapped in try-catch
- Failures logged but don't break core functionality
- Graceful degradation if notification system fails

## Testing Recommendations

### Chat Notifications
1. Send a direct message between two users
2. Verify receiver gets notification
3. Check notification directs to chat page
4. Test with user offline - should see on next login

### Group Chat Notifications
1. Send message in a group
2. Verify all members except sender get notification
3. Check notification includes group name

### Document Assignment
1. Assign document to employee
2. Verify employee receives notification immediately
3. Check notification details (document name, assigner)

### Document Upload
1. Employee uploads document
2. Verify HR receives notification
3. Verify manager receives notification
4. Check notification includes uploader name

### Document Review
1. HR/Manager reviews and approves document
2. Verify employee receives notification
3. Check status is correctly shown (Verified/Rejected)
4. Verify remarks are included

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Reviewer Detection**
   - Currently uses placeholder for reviewer name in review endpoint
   - Should pass actual reviewer info from authentication context

2. **Batch Notifications**
   - For multiple messages/documents in short time
   - Could summarize: "3 new messages from John"

3. **Notification Preferences**
   - Allow users to configure notification types
   - Quiet hours, digest mode, etc.

4. **Read Receipts**
   - Mark notifications as read when user views chat/documents
   - Auto-dismiss related notifications

5. **Rich Notifications**
   - Include file previews for documents
   - Message content formatting for chat

## Compliance with E-connect Flow

✅ Uses existing notification infrastructure
✅ Follows role-based access patterns
✅ Maintains user hierarchy (Employee → Manager → HR → Admin)
✅ Consistent with existing notification types (task, leave, wfh, etc.)
✅ Uses WebSocket for real-time delivery
✅ Stores in existing Notifications collection
✅ Compatible with existing notification UI components

## Files Modified

1. **Econnect_backend/Mongo.py**
   - Added 6 new notification functions
   - All functions follow existing patterns

2. **Econnect_backend/Server.py**
   - Updated 4 endpoints (2 async conversions, 2 integrations)
   - Added notification calls in 2 websocket handlers
   - All changes backward compatible

## No Frontend Changes Required

The existing notification system in the frontend (`EnhancedNotificationDashboard.jsx`, `NotificationBell.jsx`) will automatically display these new notifications without any modifications needed.
