# Task Notification System Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The notification system was only notifying the task owner (employee) when they added comments, subtasks, or uploaded files to their tasks. Managers were not receiving notifications about employee activities on assigned tasks.

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the `edit_the_task` function in `Mongo.py` to implement a **hierarchy-based notification system**:

### Notification Flow:

#### 1. Comments
- **Employee adds comment** → Notify their Manager
- **Manager adds comment** → Notify HR
- No self-notification (users don't get notified for their own actions)

#### 2. File Uploads  
- **Employee uploads file** → Notify their Manager
- **Manager uploads file** → Notify HR
- No self-notification (users don't get notified for their own actions)

#### 3. Subtasks
- **Employee adds subtask** → Notify their Manager  
- **Manager adds subtask** → Notify HR

### Key Features Added:

1. **Role-Based Hierarchy Detection**
   - Uses `get_user_role()` to determine if user is Employee, Manager, or HR
   - Routes notifications accordingly

2. **Manager Identification**
   - Checks `assigned_by` field (who assigned the task) 
   - Falls back to `TL` field (Team Leader)
   - Falls back to user's `TL` or `manager` field from profile

3. **Dual Notification System**
   - Database notifications (persistent)
   - Real-time WebSocket notifications (immediate)

4. **Enhanced Metadata**
   - Includes `notification_hierarchy` field ("employee_to_manager" or "manager_to_hr")
   - Stores employee/manager details for context

### Code Changes Made:

1. **Comment Notifications** (Lines ~2048-2148)
   - Added hierarchy-based logic
   - Manager → HR notifications
   - Employee → Manager notifications

2. **File Upload Notifications** (Lines ~2150-2300) 
   - Added hierarchy-based logic
   - Improved uploader identification from uploadedBy field
   - Manager → HR notifications
   - Employee → Manager notifications

3. **Subtask Notifications** (Lines ~2302-2400)
   - Added hierarchy-based logic  
   - Manager → HR notifications
   - Employee → Manager notifications

4. **WebSocket Integration**
   - All manager/HR notifications now send real-time WebSocket updates
   - Includes error handling for WebSocket failures

### Notification Examples:

**Before Fix:**
- Employee adds comment → Only employee gets notified ❌

**After Fix:**
- Employee adds comment → Manager gets notified ✅
- Manager adds comment → HR gets notified ✅
- No self-notifications ✅

## Testing Scenarios:

1. **Employee adds comment to their task** → Manager should receive notification
2. **Manager adds comment to their task** → HR should receive notification  
3. **Employee uploads file to their task** → Manager should receive notification
4. **Manager uploads file to their task** → HR should receive notification
5. **Employee adds subtask to their task** → Manager should receive notification
6. **Manager adds subtask to their task** → HR should receive notification

## Files Modified:
- `c:\Users\sadha\OneDrive\Desktop\E-Connect\Attendance-user\backend\Mongo.py`
  - Enhanced `edit_the_task()` function with hierarchy-based notifications

## Dependencies Used:
- Existing `get_user_role()` function
- Existing `get_hr_users()` function  
- Existing `get_role_based_action_url()` function
- Existing WebSocket notification system via `notification_manager`

The fix ensures that managers stay informed about employee activities on assigned tasks, and HR stays informed about manager activities, creating a proper notification hierarchy throughout the organization.
